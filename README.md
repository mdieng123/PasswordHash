# PasswordHash
This script defines a function hash_password that takes a password as input and returns a secure hash of the password using the SHA-256 algorithm. The main function prompts the user to enter a password, then calls the hash_password function to generate a hash of the password. Finally, the script prints the hashed password to the console.

This simple script demonstrates one way that passwords can be securely hashed and stored in a database to protect against unauthorized access. Hashing passwords helps to ensure that even if a database is compromised, the passwords themselves are not revealed, as the original passwords cannot be easily recovered from their hashed versions.
